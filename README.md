# Visualisation Project in Tableau

# # Geo-Tagging | # Visualization | # Tableau

This project was an attempt to study Data visualization using Tableau. Serendeptiously, I came across a visualization of thermal power in the whole world developed by Carbon Brief (https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-worlds-coal-power-plants). Carbon Brief sourced their data from www.globalenergymonitor.com and it had a plethora of information regarding thermal power plants. The data of the Indian power plants had some very interesting attributes like parent company, installed capacity, cancelled projects, retired projects, start year etc. However, my plan of plotting the thermal plants hit a road block when I found that geo-location (latitude and longitude) was not available.
Further perusal and experimentation with geo-tagging literature available on the internet yielded the following method of finding latitude and logitudes of 662 numbers of power stations.
